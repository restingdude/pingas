# Micronutrients Available from Supplements

**Purpose**: Comprehensive list of micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, bioactives) for your app, mapped to our 18 stats (e.g., Energy, Focus, Immunity). Users log intake (e.g., “500 mg NMN”) to boost stats per dosage model (Low/Med/High). Dosages reflect my Blueprint protocol or RCT-backed ranges. Consult a doctor; risks include overdose (e.g., excess vitamin A = toxicity).

### App Implementation
- **Mapping**: Users log micronutrients (e.g., “Vitamin C, 1,000 mg”), app applies boosts from dosage model (e.g., Med dose = +15 Immunity).
- **User Effects**: Adjust via inputs (e.g., age >50: *0.8; low baseline: *1.5). Example: User with low NAD+ gets +25 Energy from NMN vs. +20 standard.
- **Gamification**: Earn XP per dose (e.g., 30 XP for NMN, 50 XP for Spermidine). Advanced Quests: "Take 10mg Spermidine for 30 days" (Autophagy Master badge). Progression tiers: Basic → Longevity Specialist → Cellular Optimizer → Metabolic Master. Unlock advanced compounds like Urolithin A, NDGA, Plasmalogens at higher levels.
- **Risks**: Warn on overdose (e.g., Vitamin A >10,000 IU = -5 stats). Teens: Avoid heavy doses (mouse studies: beta-cell risks).

### Notes
- **Completeness**: Now covers 50+ micronutrients from basic vitamins to cutting-edge longevity compounds like Spermidine, NDGA, Urolithin A. Includes Bryan Johnson's complete Blueprint protocol. Matches our 18 stats with progression tiers for gamification.
